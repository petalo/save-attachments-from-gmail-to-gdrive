- âœ… Created configurable AI provider selection system
- âœ… Completed multi-user support
- âœ… Implemented intelligent attachment filtering
- âœ… Created comprehensive documentation
- âœ… Developed multiple deployment options
- âœ… Added support for production and test environments

### Upcoming Milestones

- ðŸ”² Gather user feedback and implement improvements
- ðŸ”² Enhance performance for large email volumes
- ðŸ”² Add more advanced configuration options
- ðŸ”² Develop automated testing

## Known Issues

### Limitations

1. **Thread-Level Processing**: New messages in already processed threads won't be automatically processed
   - **Workaround**: Manually remove the "GDrive_Processed" label to force reprocessing

2. **Execution Time Limits**: Google Apps Script's 6-minute limit restricts batch size
   - **Workaround**: Use smaller batch sizes and more frequent trigger executions

3. **Folder Duplication**: Rare race conditions can create duplicate domain folders
   - **Workaround**: The script includes lock logic to minimize this, but it can still occur

4. **Large Attachment Handling**: Attachments over 25MB cannot be processed due to Gmail limitations
   - **Workaround**: None available; this is a Gmail API limitation

5. **GCP Project Association Permission Issues**: Scripts associated with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects can experience permission issues
   - **Workaround**: Create a new script without GCP association
   - **Future Investigation**: Research why GCP association causes permission issues and if there's a better solution

### Edge Cases

1. **Complex HTML Emails**: Some complex HTML emails may have embedded images that aren't properly filtered
   - **Status**: Partially addressed with current filtering logic
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Non-Standard Email Clients**: Emails sent from uncommon email clients may have unusual attachment formats
   - **Status**: Basic handling implemented
   - **Priority**: Low

3. **Very Large Email Volumes**: Performance with thousands of unprocessed emails not fully tested
   - **Status**: Works with moderate volumes
   - **Priority**: Medium

4. **Folder Naming Conflicts**: Potential issues with similar domains creating naming conflicts
   - **Status**: Basic handling implemented
   - **Priority**: Low

### Technical Debt

1. **Error Handling Consistency**: Some functions have more robust error handling than others
   - **Impact**: Low - core functions have good error handling
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Logging Verbosity**: Current logging may be excessive in some areas, insufficient in others
   - **Impact**: Low - affects troubleshooting, not functionality
   - **Priority**: Low

3. **Code Duplication**: Some utility functions could be further consolidated
   - **Impact**: Low - minimal duplication exists
   - **Priority**: Low

4. **Testing Coverage**: No automated tests
   - **Impact**: Medium - relies on manual testing
   - **Priority**: Medium
