# Product Context: Gmail Attachment Organizer

## Why This Project Exists

Email attachments are a critical part of professional and personal communication, but they often get lost in crowded inboxes. The Gmail Attachment Organizer exists to solve this problem by automatically extracting and organizing attachments from Gmail into a structured Google Drive folder system. This allows users to:

1. **Find attachments easily** without digging through email threads
2. **Maintain organization** of important files automatically
3. **Save time** by eliminating manual downloading and filing
4. **Ensure important files aren't missed** in busy email workflows

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Email Attachment Chaos

Attachments in Gmail can quickly become disorganized and difficult to locate, especially for users who receive many emails with attachments. This project provides automatic organization based on sender domains, creating a logical structure that makes finding specific attachments intuitive.

### 2. Manual Processing Burden

Without automation, users must manually download, rename, and organize attachments, which is time-consuming and error-prone. This script eliminates that burden by handling the entire process automatically.

### 3. Embedded Content Confusion

Email clients often include embedded images (signatures, logos, etc.) as attachments, cluttering attachment lists with non-essential files. The script intelligently filters these out, focusing only on meaningful attachments.

### 4. Cross-Platform Accessibility

Attachments stored only in Gmail are less accessible across devices and platforms. By moving them to Google Drive, they become available in a more versatile storage system with better sharing and collaboration features.

### 5. Email Storage Limitations

Gmail has storage limits that can be quickly consumed by large attachments. Moving attachments to Google Drive helps manage email storage more effectively.

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Setup**
   - User creates a Google Drive folder for attachments
   - User installs the script in Google Apps Script
   - User configures the script with their Drive folder ID
   - User authorizes necessary permissions
   - User sets up a trigger for automatic execution

2. **Ongoing Operation (Invisible to User)**
   - Script runs automatically at scheduled intervals
   - Script searches for unprocessed emails with attachments
   - Script extracts sender domain information
   - Script filters out unwanted attachments
   - Script creates domain folders as needed
   - Script saves attachments to appropriate folders
   - Script marks emails as processed

3. **User Interaction with Results**
   - User browses organized attachments in Google Drive
   - User can search by domain to find specific attachments
   - User can view original email date in file descriptions
   - User can manually trigger reprocessing if needed

### Key Operational Principles

1. **Non-Destructive**: The script never deletes emails or original attachments
2. **Intelligent Filtering**: Automatically distinguishes between real attachments and embedded content
3. **Batch Processing**: Handles emails in manageable batches to avoid timeouts
4. **Error Resilience**: Continues processing despite individual failures
5. **Configurable**: Allows customization of filtering rules and processing options

## User Experience Goals

### 1. Effortless Setup

The installation process should be straightforward, with clear documentation and minimal technical requirements. Users should be able to get the system running with just a few steps.

### 2. "Set and Forget" Operation

Once configured, the system should operate autonomously without requiring ongoing user attention or maintenance. Users should trust that their attachments are being organized without their intervention.

### 3. Intuitive Organization

The domain-based folder structure should feel natural and make logical sense to users. Finding attachments should be intuitive based on remembering who sent them.

### 4. Minimal Learning Curve

Users should not need to learn complex new systems or interfaces. The organization should leverage the familiar Google Drive interface that users already know.

### 5. Adaptable to User Needs

Through configuration options, the system should adapt to different user preferences and requirements, such as which domains to skip or how to handle certain file types.

### 6. Transparent Operation

While running automatically, the system should provide clear logs and status information so users can verify it's working correctly and troubleshoot if necessary.

## Success Metrics from User Perspective

1. **Time Saved**: Reduction in time spent manually organizing and searching for attachments
2. **Findability**: Ability to quickly locate specific attachments when needed
3. **Completeness**: Confidence that all important attachments are being captured
4. **Maintenance Effort**: Minimal time spent managing or troubleshooting the system
5. **Organization Quality**: Logical structure that makes intuitive sense to the user
