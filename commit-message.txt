feat(detection): add email-based invoice detection

# Email-Based Invoice Detection

This commit adds a new method for detecting invoices based on the sender's email address. This approach is more privacy-focused than AI-based detection and can be more efficient for known invoice senders.

## Key Changes

- Enhanced `extractDomain` function in `Utils.gs` to properly handle email addresses with display names (e.g., "Company Name <email@domain.com>")
- Updated `isInvoiceSender` function in `InvoiceDetection.gs` to extract email addresses from the "From" field when they include display names
- Added support for various matching patterns in the invoice senders list:
  - Full domains (e.g., "example.com")
  - Explicit wildcard domains (e.g., "*@example.com")
  - Specific email addresses (e.g., "billing@example.com")
  - Prefix wildcards (e.g., "invoice*@example.com")
  - Suffix wildcards (e.g., "*-noreply@example.com")
  - Prefix-suffix wildcards (e.g., "invoice*info@example.com")
- Added configuration option `invoiceDetection: "email"` to enable this detection method
- Created `InvoiceSenders.gs` file to store the list of known invoice senders
- Updated build process to properly handle the `INVOICES_FOLDER_NAME` environment variable

## Benefits

- More privacy-focused than AI-based detection (no email content analysis)
- Faster processing as it only requires checking the sender
- More predictable results for known senders
- Can be used as a fallback when AI-based detection is unavailable or fails

## Usage

Set `invoiceDetection: "email"` in the configuration to enable email-based invoice detection. Add known invoice senders to the `INVOICE_SENDERS` array in `InvoiceSenders.gs`.
